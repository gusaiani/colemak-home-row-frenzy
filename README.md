# Lots of keystrokes on homerow for Colemak keyboards

## Why use these snippets?
You use the Colemak layout to program.

You always make mistakes typing `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `|` and other characters that need a pinky finger reach.

Typing character combinations in one keystroke sounds like a great idea to you.

You don’t mind using crazy modifier keys on the left hand to gain productivity.

### Okay, but really why?
By now, you probably know that your right pinky finger travels a lot to hit typical programming keys.
As a matter of fact, it is responsible for 13 keys, some of them very far ( `\` ) and adjacent to others which have no ergonomic anchor ( `]` ) — and that’s not counting function keys and the arrows.

So here’s the tradeoff: by hitting what amounts to _chords_ of keys on the left hand, and by making sure these chords are always in the same place and don’t vary too much, you may very quickly start making less and less mistakes when typing pinky-heavy keys.

For good measure, you’ll find three shortcuts that produce two consecutive keystrokes that are typical in certain programming languages and are error-prone to type.

As always with Keyboard Maestro, you can set these macros to be used only in certain apps, but so far I have been able to use them anywhere without creating any shortcut conflict.
